# CovidKashmir Widgets
Repository to Store Embeddable Widgets from the site [covidkashmir.org](https://covidkashmir.org)

## Contributing

1. Fork the repo
2. Create your widgets using data from the api `https://covidkashmir.org/api/live`
3. Store the widget files in `widgets/<widget-name>` under the following structure  

    ``` bash
    widgets
    |-- <widget-name>
        |-- widget.js       (The widget JS file)
        |-- widget.css      (The widget CSS file)
        |-- README.md       (The widget README file)

    ```

4. Submit a Pull Request

*Note: Ideally, no other file should be required to go along with your widget, but if you have some files, like fonts, etc, mention them in the README*

## Future Plans

A website displaying all the widgets that is auto generated.
